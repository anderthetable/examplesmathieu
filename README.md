Hello Mathieu, those are mine firts experiments with mainnet-js library.  
grk.js is a simple script, where I tied to make a simple betgame with a cashtoken.  
GrokyGame.js is a component that I made to use on a Next.js web, that implements the previous script, making the game usable on a web.  
As I say you may have not the best practices, but it is a starting point for me with BCH development
