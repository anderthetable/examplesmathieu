# Hello Mathieu  
These are my first experiments with the mainnet-js library.  
- grk.js is a simple script, where I tried to create a simple betgame with a cashtoken.  
- GrokyGame.js is a component that I made to use on a Next.js webapp, that implements the previous script, making the game playable on a website.
- - GrokyGamev2.js bunch of experiments, dont care about that
  - GrokyGamev3.js is the actual version with improves
- p2pbot.js is a simple bot in process for p2p trading of bch on telegram
As I said you, it may not follow the best practices, but it's a starting point for me in BCH development
